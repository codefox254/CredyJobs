# Proxy API requests from React to Django backend
# This allows the frontend to call /api/* and have it forwarded to the backend server
# Change the target below to match your backend server address and port
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
PORT=3000

# Proxy for development
# If using create-react-app, you can also use:
# proxy = "http://localhost:8000"
